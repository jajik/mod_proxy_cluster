mod_cluster
===========

Project mod_cluster is a httpd-based load-balancer. It uses a communication channel to forward
requests from httpd to one of a set of application server nodes. Unlike mod_jk and mod_proxy,
mod_cluster leverages an additional connection between the application server nodes and httpd
to transmit server-side load-balance factors and lifecycle events back to httpd. This additional
feedback channel allows mod_cluster to offer a level of intelligence and granularity not found in
other load-balancing solutions.

Mod_cluster boasts the following advantages over other httpd-based load-balancers:

* Dynamic configuration of httpd workers
* Server-side load balance factor calculation
* Fine grained web-app lifecycle control
* AJP is optional
